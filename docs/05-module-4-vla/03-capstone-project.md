# 5.3 Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid 🤖🏆

In this capstone project, we integrate all prior modules — **perception, LLM planning, voice control, and kinematics** — to create a fully **autonomous humanoid robot** capable of executing complex tasks in a simulated or real environment.

---

# 🌟 Capstone Goals

* Combine **voice-to-action, cognitive planning, and movement control** 🗣️🧠🦿
* Execute multi-step instructions autonomously 🏃‍♂️
* Maintain **balance and stability** using kinematics and CoM calculations ⚖️
* Test the robot in **dynamic and interactive scenarios** 🌐

# 🔍 1. Task Workflow Overview

1. **Receive Instruction**
   User commands robot:

   > "Pick up the blue cup from the kitchen and place it on the table in the living room."

2. **Speech-to-Text Processing**
   Whisper transcribes spoken commands into text 🎤

3. **Cognitive Planning**
   LLM generates **structured action plan**: navigate, detect object, grasp, move, release 📝

4. **Sensor Perception & Navigation**
   Depth cameras, LiDAR, and IMU feed real-time data for obstacle avoidance and localization 🌟

5. **Humanoid Motion Execution**
   Kinematics ensures safe walking, balancing, and manipulation 🤖🦿

6. **Feedback & Replanning**
   Robot adapts plan if obstacles or errors occur 🔄

# 🛠️ 2. Example: Multi-Step Plan Execution

```python
# Sample plan generated by LLM
plan = [
    {"action": "navigate", "target": "kitchen"},
    {"action": "detect_object", "color": "blue", "object": "cup"},
    {"action": "grasp", "object": "cup"},
    {"action": "navigate", "target": "living_room"},
    {"action": "release", "object": "cup"}
]

for step in plan:
    if robot.can_execute(step):
        robot.execute(step)
    else:
        robot.replan(step)
```

**Explanation**:

* Robot loops through plan steps
* Checks feasibility before executing
* Adjusts for real-world conditions dynamically

---

# 🧠 3. Integration Highlights

* **Whisper → LLM → ROS 2 → Humanoid Robot**
* Real-time sensor feedback ensures **robust perception** 👁️
* Kinematics and CoM calculations maintain **dynamic balance** ⚖️
* Modular design allows **future expansion** for more tasks and environments 🌐

---

# 🔍 4. Testing Scenarios

* **Home Environment**: Fetch and place objects, open doors 🏡
* **Industrial Environment**: Pick-and-place items on conveyor belts 🏭
* **Interactive Demonstrations**: Respond to spoken commands and adjust to moving obstacles 🎮
